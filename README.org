**** Dependencies
1. [[https://nodejs.org/][nodejs]] - Version 18 or later
2. [[https://pandoc.org/][pandoc]] - Version 3.5 or later

**** How to run
1. Run =npm install= to install the dependencies.
2. Run =npm run docs:dev= to start the development server.

**** How it works
Publishing documentation to the Github pages follows a multi-step process:
1. Once =docs= are updated in the[[https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode][ nvim-orgmode]] repository,
   [[https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode/blob/master/.github/workflows/web_docs.yml][workflow]] runs to push the =docs= folder to this repository
2. Once the =docs= folder is up to date, another [[https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/nvim-orgmode.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml][workflow]] runs, which does these steps:
   1. Converts =org= files to =markdown= files with =pandoc=
   2. Builds the =vitepress= site from the =markdown= files
   3. Pushes the =vitepress= site to the =gh-pages= branch
